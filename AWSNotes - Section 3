Notes for AWS

AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS infrastructure works from:
Regions
  All around the world. Ex. US-East-1, EU-West-3...etc. This is a cluster of data centers. Most AWS services are region-scoped. 
  How to choose which AWS region? Things to consider are Compliance, Proximy (Latency), which services are available (not all services are available in each region), and pricing. 
Availability Zones
  These are the zones within a region usually 3, minimum is 3 and the max is 6. Example: AWS Region Syndney: ap-southeast-2. There are 3 availability zones within that region: ap-southeast-2a, ap-southeast-2b, and ap-southeast-2c.
  Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity. Each AZ is seperate from themselves so that they're isolated from disasters
