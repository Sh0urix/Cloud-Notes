IAM = Identity and Access Management - Global Service

Root account is created by default, shouldn't be used or shared. 
Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped. 

Groups can only contain users, not other groups
Users don't have to belong to a group, and users can belong to multiple groups. 

IAM Permissions
Users or groups can be assigned JSON documents called Policies. These policies define the permissions of the users. Utilize the least privilege principle.
