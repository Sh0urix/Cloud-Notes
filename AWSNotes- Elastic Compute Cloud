Budgets can be created to prevent an overage on charges. These can be customized based on spending monthly, zero-spend budget, daily savings plan coverage budget, or daily reservation utilization budget.

EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud - Infrastructure as a Service
It mainly consists in the capability of:
  Renting Virtual Machines (EC2)
  Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
  Distributing load across machines (ELB)
  Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the cloud works. 

EC2 Sizing and Configurations
  Operating Systems (OS): Windows, Linux and Mac OS
  How much compute power & cores (CPU)
  How much RAM
  How much storage space: Network attached (EBS & EFS), hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
  Network card: speed of the card, public IP address
  Firewall Rules: Security Group
  Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data
it is possible to boostrap our instances using an EC2 User data script
boostrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
That script is only run once at the instance first start
EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as: install updates, install software, download common files from the internet, anything else you can think of
  This script runs with root user, so it has sudo privileges. 
t2.micro is part of the AWS free tier (up to 750 hours per month)

EC2 Instance Types - Overview
Each instance type are optimised for different use cases
AWS uses the following naming convention:
  m5.2xlarge

m: instance class 
5: generation of instance
2xlarge: size within the instance class

General purpose: Great for diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories

Compute Optimized: Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors

Memory Optimized: Fast perforamnce for workloads that process large data sets in memory

Storage Optimized: Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage

Security Groups: fundamental network security in AWS
  control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 instances
  Security groups only contain allow rules
  Security Groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
  Can be attached to multiple instances
  Locked down to a region / VPC combination
  It's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
